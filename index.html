        <p class="bio">
            Experienced Principal Software Engineer with 20 years of expertise in designing and delivering scalable
            backend solutions across healthcare, utilities, retail, defence, and education. A backend-focused engineer
            with a passion for software architecture, I have worked across the full software stack in roles including
            consultant, tester, and support. Skilled in cloud technologies, microservices architecture, and automation,
            I thrive on solving complex technical challenges. While AI and machine learning are not my primary focus, I
            bring added value with experience in generative AI. Passionate about mentoring teams, improving system
            performance, and driving innovation, I am committed to delivering high-quality, reliable solutions that help
            businesses scale and succeed.
